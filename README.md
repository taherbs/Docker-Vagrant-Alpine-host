## Configure Vagrant guest host

You can configure the Vagrant guest vm by editing the *nodes.yaml*s.
Duplicate the [nodes.yaml.sample](./nodes.yaml.sample) or rename it into *nodes.yaml* than set params according to your system.

## Usage:

Provision the VM and ssh it:
*NOTE*: *On Windows run your PowerShell terminal as administrator*

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

## Useful commands:

```bash
vagrant destroy #delete the VM, and you will lose all work on the instance
vagrant up      #create a VM
vagrant suspend #suspend the vm
vagrant resume  #resume a suspended vm
```
